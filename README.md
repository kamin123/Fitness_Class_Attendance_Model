# Fitness_Class_Attendance_Model

GoalZone is a fitness club chain in Canada.  
GoalZone offers a range of fitness classes in two capacities - 25 and 15.   
Some classes are always fully booked. Fully booked classes often have a low attendance rate.   
GoalZone wants to increase the number of spaces available for classes.   
They want to do this by predicting whether the member will attend the class or not.   
If they can predict a member will not attend the class, they can make another space available.  


This dataset contained 1500 observations and 8 variables.  
Packages used in my analysis were: Pandas, Seaborn, Numpy, Matplotlib and Sklearn.  
To obtain my predictions, I first performed data validation making sure that all variables matched the criteria given to me. 
I then went on to do exploratory data analysis checking the distributions of variables and plotting variables against one another looking for any relationships.  
I finished with creating a **Logistic Regression** Model as a baseline and then creating a **Decision Tree** Model for a comparison to test the prediction against.   
I went on to test the predictions with a classification report, specically looking at accuracy.  

With further projects, I plan to test more **binary classification models**, optimize variables included to create more efficient analysis and adjust hyperparameters to return a maximum accuracy score. 

Thank you.
